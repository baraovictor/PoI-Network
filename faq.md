# FAQ ‚Äì Is PoI Technically Viable?

## ‚ùì Is it really possible to process AI jobs on a remote GPU or CPU?

**Yes.** It is technically feasible and already implemented in many forms ‚Äî including API-based inference, remote rendering, and distributed research computing.

### ‚úÖ Real-World Proofs of Concept

- **Hugging Face Spaces / Banana.dev / Replicate.com**  
  Inference jobs are sent via API, processed in remote containers, and return results ‚Äî often on third-party idle GPUs.

- **Render farms & cloud GPU services**  
  Video and 3D rendering has long used remote GPUs to process heavy jobs and return outputs.

- **BOINC / Folding@Home / Decentralized compute**  
  Distributed compute projects proved that tasks can be securely and reliably processed on volunteer machines.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How PoI Would Work

1. A job is hashed and submitted to the PoI Network.
2. A node accepts the job and runs it locally in an isolated container.
3. The result is signed and returned to the orchestrator.
4. Verification occurs (checksum + optional redundancy).
5. The node is rewarded proportionally to its contribution.
