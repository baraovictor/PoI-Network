# Viability of PoI Network

## 💡 The Problem
Massive demand for AI inference is outpacing supply. Major providers like OpenAI face compute shortages, while billions in idle GPU power remains untapped globally.

## 🔁 The Solution: PoI
PoI Network turns idle compute into rewarded, decentralized AI inference — with low energy, high inclusivity, and job validation.

## ⚙️ Technical Feasibility
- Models can now run on mid-tier GPUs (quantized/optimized)
- Execution frameworks are mature (ONNX, TensorRT, Metal)
- Inferencing is lighter than mining — less wear, less power

## 🌍 Economic Feasibility
- Energy cost/job is low; payout can scale
- Circular economy: compute earns credits, used in AI again

## 🤝 Social Feasibility
- Opens AI access to communities, creators, universities
- Incentivizes clean energy use (solar, hydro, off-grid)

## 🛡️ Security & Integrity
- Hash-based job tracking
- Encrypted payloads
- Cross-node validation and scoring

## 📈 Scalable by Design
- Starts with inference, expands to personal/educational AI
- Global growth powered by hardware already in circulation

**PoI is not speculative. It’s computational.**
