# PoI Network â€“ Proof of Intelligence

A decentralized AI inference protocol that transforms idle compute power into useful intelligence work.

## Overview
PoI connects unused GPUs and efficient machines across the world into an incentivized network for running AI inference tasks.

### Key Concepts:
- Jobs = Hashes
- Distributed pools (CUDA, OpenCL, Apple Silicon)
- Fair, proportional rewards
- Low energy footprint
- Circular economy model

PoI â€“ Proof of Intelligence is a decentralized AI inference protocol that transforms idle compute power into real-time intelligence mining.

Built for creators, researchers, communities, and any GPU owner â€” PoI allows users to earn credits or stablecoins by contributing computational power to AI tasks like image generation and LLM inference.

Inspired by Proof of Work, evolved for sustainable AI.

ðŸ§  Not about speculation â€” about computation.
