## 🧠 Overview

PoI connects unused GPUs and efficient machines around the world into an incentivized network for running AI inference jobs — including image generation and LLM tasks.

### Key Concepts
- Jobs = Hashes
- Distributed pools (CUDA, ROCm/OpenCL, Apple Silicon)
- Fair, proportional rewards
- Low energy usage
- Circular economy model

## 🎯 Vision

PoI is built on the belief that intelligence should not be centralized, and that computation can be both inclusive and sustainable.

> It's not about speculation — it's about computation.
