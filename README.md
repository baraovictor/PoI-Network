# PoI Network – Proof of Intelligence

A decentralized AI inference protocol that transforms idle compute power into useful intelligence work.

## Overview
PoI connects unused GPUs and efficient machines across the world into an incentivized network for running AI inference tasks.

### Key Concepts:
- Jobs = Hashes
- Distributed pools (CUDA, OpenCL, Apple Silicon)
- Fair, proportional rewards
- Low energy footprint
- Circular economy model

> It's not about speculation. It's about computation.
