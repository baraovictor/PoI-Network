# Initial Issues – PoI Network

## Issue #1 – Define MVP for PoI Node
Scope a minimum viable version of a PoI node: job intake, model execution (e.g., SD 1.5), result validation, wallet integration.

## Issue #2 – Build job scheduler logic (Orchestrator prototype)
Design job assignment system based on device benchmark score, architecture type, and availability.

## Issue #3 – Create PoI Token mechanics (reward unit)
Draft how rewards are calculated per job, based on energy cost, completion rate, and model complexity.

## Issue #4 – Design pilot interface (lightweight GUI or CLI)
Create a simple front-end or terminal dashboard to monitor jobs, earnings, and device usage.
